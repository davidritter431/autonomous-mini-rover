## Project Vision

The Autonomous Mini-Rover is a summer engineering project focused on developing practical, system-level skills in:

- Embedded C programming
- Circuit integration and power system design
- Custom PCB development
- 3D modeling and mechanical design
- Real-time telemetry and control interfaces

The goal is to evolve from a breadboard prototype into a fully integrated robotic platform with a custom-designed PCB and 3D-printed chassis.

## System Architecture

The rover is divided into four major subsystems:

### 1. Embedded Control System
- Microcontroller running embedded C
- PWM motor control
- UART-based telemetry communication
- Sensor data acquisition
- Finite state machine for autonomous behaviors

### 2. Power System
- Battery-powered operation
- Voltage regulation for logic and motors
- Decoupling and filtering for noise reduction
- Motor-driver isolation considerations

### 3. Mechanical System
- Custom 3D printed chassis
- Sensor mounting brackets
- PCB mounting design
- Modular frame for future expansion

### 4. Ground Interface
- Python-based telemetry GUI
- Real-time sensor visualization
- Command transmission to rover
- Expandable for data logging and diagnostics
